# Autonomous Vehicle Localization
This repository contains a ROS docker image that can be deployed on an autonomous vehicle known as a "duckiebot". The image has a program that enables the vehicle to follow lanes on a roadway based on lane lines. Additionally, the vehicle performs pose-estimation using a combination of odometry data and fiducial markers.
